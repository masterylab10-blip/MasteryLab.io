                <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

                <p>Welcome to MasteryLab. By registering for our workshops, labs, or events, you agree to comply with
                    and be bound by the following Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.</p>

                <h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>
                <p>These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all contracts concluded between MasteryLab
                    (hereinafter "Organizer") and participants (hereinafter "Participant") regarding attendance at dance
                    workshops, training labs, and related events organized by MasteryLab in Switzerland.</p>

                <h2>2. Registration and Conclusion of Contract</h2>
                <p>Registration for events must be made via the official registration forms provided on the MasteryLab
                    website. By clicking the "Submit" or "Proceed to Payment" button, the Participant makes a binding
                    offer to conclude a contract.</p>
                <p>The contract is formed when the Organizer confirms the registration (e.g., via email) or processes
                    the payment. The Organizer reserves the right to reject registrations without stating reasons.</p>

                <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>Participation fees are due immediately upon registration. Payments are processed securely via
                    third-party providers (e.g., Stripe, TicketTailor). All prices are in Swiss Francs (CHF) unless
                    stated otherwise. If payment fails or is charged back, the Participant loses their claim to a spot
                    in the event.</p>

                <h2>4. Cancellation and Refunds</h2>
                <p><strong>By the Participant:</strong> Due to the nature of the events (limited capacity workshops),
                    tickets are generally non-refundable. However, tickets may be transferable to another person of the
                    same dance role (Leader/Follower) up to 72 hours before the event, subject to Organizer approval.
                </p>
                <p><strong>By the Organizer:</strong> If an event is cancelled by MasteryLab (e.g., due to instructor
                    illness or insufficient participants), paid fees will be fully refunded. Further claims for damages
                    (e.g., travel/accommodation costs) are excluded.</p>

                <h2>5. Liability Waiver & Physical Health</h2>
                <p>The Participant acknowledges that dance training involves physical exertion and carries an inherent
                    risk of injury. Participation is entirely at the Participant's own risk.</p>
                <p>MasteryLab and its instructors accept no liability for personal injury, property damage, or theft
                    occurring during the event, except in cases of intent or gross negligence. Liability for slight
                    negligence is excluded to the extent permitted by Swiss law (Art. 100 OR).</p>
                <p>The Participant confirms they are in good physical health and fit to participate.</p>

                <h2>6. Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>MasteryLab is committed to providing a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment. Harassment,
                    discrimination, or inappropriate behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. The Organizer reserves
                    the right to expel any Participant violating these rules without refund.</p>

                <h2>7. Media Release (Photos & Videos)</h2>
                <p>By attending, the Participant agrees that the Organizer may record photos and videos of the event for
                    promotional purposes (social media, website). If a Participant does not wish to be filmed, they must
                    inform the Organizer in writing before the event starts.</p>

                <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>Course materials, choreographies, and teaching methods presented are the intellectual property of the
                    instructors and MasteryLab. Recording entire classes is prohibited without explicit permission.</p>

                <h2>9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
                <p>These terms are governed by <strong>Swiss Law</strong>. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all
                    disputes arising from this contract is <strong>Olten, Switzerland</strong> (or the competent court
                    for MasteryLab's registered seat).</p>

                <h2>10. Contact</h2>
